Logical rules for the mushroom data sets.

	Logical rules given below seem to be the simplest possible for the
	mushroom dataset and therefore should be treated as benchmark results.

	Disjunctive rules for poisonous mushrooms, from most general
	to most specific:

	P_1) odor=NOT(almond.OR.anise.OR.none)
	     120 poisonous cases missed, 98.52% accuracy

	P_2) spore-print-color=green
	     48 cases missed, 99.41% accuracy
         
	P_3) odor=none.AND.stalk-surface-below-ring=scaly.AND.
	          (stalk-color-above-ring=NOT.brown) 
	     8 cases missed, 99.90% accuracy
         
	P_4) habitat=leaves.AND.cap-color=white
	         100% accuracy     

	Rule P_4) may also be

	P_4') population=clustered.AND.cap_color=white

	These rule involve 6 attributes (out of 22). Rules for edible
	mushrooms are obtained as negation of the rules given above, for
	example the rule:

	odor=(almond.OR.anise.OR.none).AND.spore-print-color=NOT.green

	gives 48 errors, or 99.41% accuracy on the whole dataset.

	Several slightly more complex variations on these rules exist,
	involving other attributes, such as gill_size, gill_spacing,
	stalk_surface_above_ring, but the rules given above are the simplest
	we have found.
